# Graph Analytics Techniques

## Introduction
Welcome to the 4th module in the Graph Analytics course. Last week, we got a glimpse of a number of graph properties and why they are important. This week we will use those properties for analyzing graphs using a free and powerful graph analytics tool called Neo4j. We will demonstrate how to use Cypher, the query language of Neo4j, to perform a wide range of analyses on a variety of graph networks.
