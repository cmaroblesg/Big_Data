# Introduction to Graphs

## Introduction
Welcome! This week we will get a first exposure to graphs and their use in everyday life. By the end of the module you will be able to create a graph applying core mathematical properties of graphs, and identify the kinds of analysis questions one might be able to ask of such a graph. We hope the you will be inspired as to how graphical representations might enable you to answer new Big Data problems!
