# Graph Analytics

## What to learn in this module
Did we say in the last module that we'd be introducing a lot of terms?  Well, we hate to say it, but we're just getting started.

No, really, there's a lot of content in this module – and more terms.  We want everyone to get the core basics, so again, at the beginning of each video we will clearly list (as an in-video quiz) what we expect you to be able to do after watching that video.  But you will find there's quite a bit of even deeper content also in those videos.  Why?

The reality is, depending on the kinds of problems you are interested in, there are many different kinds of analyses you might want to know about.  So many of the lectures will go into a bit more detail than we will assess you on – because we want this class to be valuable for those who have specific kinds of problems they want to solve.

Obviously, hearing about these is valuable to everyone – you never know when you will encounter a new problem which might be amenable to some of these approaches!  But don’t worry about memorizing details beyond the learning outcomes listed at the beginning of each video.
