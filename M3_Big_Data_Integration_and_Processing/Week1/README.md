# Welcome to Big Data Integration and Processing
## Introduction
Welcome to the third course in the Big Data Specialization. This week you will be introduced to basic concepts in big data integration and processing. You will be guided through installing the Cloudera VM, downloading the data sets to be used for this course, and learning how to run the Jupyter server.

## Learning Objectives
