# Big Data Modeling and Management Systems
## About this Course
Once you’ve identified a big data issue to analyze, how do you collect, store and organize your data using Big Data solutions?  In this course, you will experience various data genres and management tools appropriate for each.  You will be able to describe the reasons behind the evolving plethora of new big data platforms from the perspective of big data management systems and analytical tools.  Through guided hands-on tutorials, you will become familiar with techniques using real-time and semi-structured data examples.  Systems and tools discussed include: AsterixDB, HP Vertica, Impala, Neo4j, Redis, SparkSQL. This course provides techniques to extract value from existing untapped data sources and discovering new data sources.\
At the end of this course, you will be able to:
 * Recognize different data elements in your own work and in everyday life problems
 * Explain why your team needs to design a Big Data Infrastructure Plan and Information System Design
 * Identify the frequent data operations required for various types of data
 * Select a data model to suit the characteristics of your data
 * Apply techniques to handle streaming data
 * Differentiate between a traditional Database Management System and a Big Data Management System
 * Appreciate why there are so many data management systems
 * Design a big data information system for an online game company

This course is for those new to data science.  Completion of Intro to Big Data is recommended.  No prior programming experience is needed, although the ability to install applications and utilize a virtual machine is necessary to complete the hands-on assignments.  Refer to the specialization technical requirements for complete hardware and software specifications.\
### Hardware Requirements:
(A) Quad Core Processor (VT-x or AMD-V support recommended), 64-bit; (B) 8 GB RAM; (C) 20 GB disk free. How to find your hardware information: (Windows): Open System by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties; (Mac): Open Overview by clicking on the Apple menu and clicking “About This Mac.” Most computers with 8 GB RAM purchased in the last 3 years will meet the minimum requirements.You will need a high speed internet connection because you will be downloading files up to 4 Gb in size.

### Software Requirements:
This course relies on several open-source software tools, including Apache Hadoop. All required software can be downloaded and installed free of charge (except for data charges from your internet provider). Software requirements include: Windows 7+, Mac OS X 10.10+, Ubuntu 14.04+ or CentOS 6+ VirtualBox 5+.

## Instructor's Note
Thanks for signing up for the Big Data Modeling and Management Systems course. The course includes five weeks of content with 2-3 modules in each. In each week, there'll be a set of lecture videos, together with a set of review questions to help you make sure you've mastered the material. Some modules also have hands on exercise in which you'll get to implement these concepts and see for yourself how they really work.\
When you complete the course, you'll come away with:
* an in-depth knowledge of why big data modeling and management is essential in preparing to gain insights from your data.
* knowledge of real world big data modeling and management use cases in areas such as energy and gaming.
* understand different kinds of data models.
* the ability to describe streaming data and the different challenges it presents
* the differences between a DBMS and a BDMS.
If you have friends who might be interested in Big Data technologies, please let them know about the class. You may want to form a study group with your friends, making the experience more fun and increasing your retention of the material.\
Happy learning!\
